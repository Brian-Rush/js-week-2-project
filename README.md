# Zoo Animal Tracker

## Description
This is a web app that helps zoo employees keep track of the zoo's animals. We were to imagine that we had been asked to create an application to track certain information, including each animal's species, name, age, diet, location in the zoo, number of caretakers required, sex, likes, and dislikes. As of July 7, 2017, this is a very rough minimum viable product -- or rather proof-of-concept -- to show my imaginary client/employer what the app would be like. If they liked the trajectory I would add many more feature. Read on to find out about those.

## Future Features

* It will be possible to sort animals by any property.
* There will be more varied form field inputs to minimize user error. For example, there will be select boxes to limit the options for sex and diet.
* It will be possible to remove animals from the list.
* A timestamp will be added to each entry to see when each animal was admitted.
* There will be appropriate error messages and hints.

## Setup/Installation Instructions
* Clone the repo.
* Navigate to the cloned directory in Terminal.
* [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/ "Node installation documentation") and [initialize Node Package Manager](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/javascript/introduction-to-javascript/introducing-npm-and-gulp) (npm).
* In Terminal, type "npm install" to install the necessary back-end dependencies.
* In Terminal, type "bower install" to install the necessary front-end dependencies.
* In Terminal, type "gulp build" to build js and css files to be included
* In Terminal, type "gulp serve" to launch the development server and view the project in your browser (Chrome is recommended)

## Known bugs

* There are no known bugs at this time, but it is important that the user enter the appropriate strings in the text inputs for 'sex' and 'diet' in order to use the sorting feature.
